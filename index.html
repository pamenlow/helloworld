<headline>Who Is Responsible For Legalizing Slavery?</headline>
 The case ise very different with the French planter and his Negroes. The perpetual servitude of the Negroes is not only consented to by that nation, but is expressly authorized by the king’s edict: “[translated french] The children who are born of marriage between slaves will be slaves, and will belong to the masters of slave women,” are terms of the perpetual edict of March, 1687. The French planter can therefore have no apprehension of losing his slave by giving him instruction, nor will the slave’s being instructed make him less willing to obey his master. There are no books to be given them to read which charge their masters with infringing both divine and human laws and by retaining them in slavery; nor are such doctrines transmitted to them under the sanction of a religious society composed of the governors of the national church. Here then is the true source of the evil, and the remedy is obvious. If the purchasing of a Negroe for a slave be an infringement of divine and human laws, in God’s name, why is such a trade permitted? A few words in an act of parliament prohibiting the importation or sale of Negroes in our colonies will destroy the practice in future -- And a few words more, declaring the offspring of Negroes already imported to be free, will prevent slavery extending to the next generation. This method is certainly the most proper, and the only one which can have efficacy; nor does it seem very consistent in any member of either house of parliament to declaim without doors against the integrity of this transaction, and bear no testimony against its encouragement within. Even the last session of parliament, 1766, furnished an occasion for asserting the rights of the Negroes, and displaying the infamy of trading in them. The act for opening free ports in the West-Indies declares Negroes a lawful commodity and to be imported and sold there upon paying a certain duty; but neither upon the passing that act, nor upon the passing any former one for the encouragement of the African trade, does there appear a single protest in abhorrence of that trade, or of treating rational creatures as property. But, besides, the perpetual servitude of the Negroes in our colonies is not the act of their masters, nor is it the mere effect of their power over those wretches. In every colony the right of the owner is fixed by the law of the colony framed under the king’s instructions, and afterwards transmitted for his approbation in his privy council; it was therefore in the discretion of the privy council to repeal all these acts of the colonies, when they were transmitted, and such of them as have not received the royal confirmation may still be repealed; and if that were done, every Negroe born in the colonies would become entitled to all the privileges and franchises of the natural born subjects of this realm. How then does it happen, that these acts, so repugnant to all divine and human laws, are suffered to exist? Are there no lords of the council sufficiently zealous in the cause of liberty and religion to procure their repeal? Or, are there none others to make application to the council for that purpose? If therefore the purchasing the Negroes for slaves be a violation of the laws of nature and humanity, it is pretty evident that the American planters do not alone bear the weight of that iniquity, nor are they only to be called upon to remove the evil. If however on the other hand the purchasing Negroes for slaves be consistent with divine and human obligations, care should be taken to secure the property of the slave to his owner under all circumstances, and such a plan of instruction should be digested, as might best conduce the Negroes eternal welfare, without making them uneasy in their present condition, or encouraging them to revolt against their owners. As the first thing to be done therefore is to determine the lawfulness of purchasing Negroes for slaves, it may be proper to state the fact fully, that those whose high office is to expound the divine will as far as it has been revealed, may be the better able to judge of the conformity or repugnance of this transaction to it.
